Questions:

1. Which type of 'kubenetes service proxies' does FO4 use? Is it Proxy-mode: userspace, Proxy-mode: iptables, or Proxy-mode: ipvs?
(https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#virtual-ips-and-service-proxies)
Is the type 'Cluster IP' and 'Node Port' fit in here?

e.g. in /th_live-182182/charts/backend/charts/service/templates/predixy-service.yaml, it defines both "Endpoint" and "Service"


2. Other than kubectl logs, is there any other place should we check during incident?
Is there a suggested way to track the reason for a pod down?

3. Could Studio introduce us with all the monitoring tools that can be shared with us?

4. Could Studio show us the procedure to setup k8s server in test environment?

5. As helm need tiller running on each node, shall we add monitoring for tiller status?

###(Below question is for internal only)###
1. We know Deployment, Pod, Service, Endpoint is used in FO4.
Is DaemonSets, Configmap, Secrets, Volumes, and Cronjob is used?
(Configmap looks only used in prometheus, I didn't find DaemonSets in server)
DaemonSets is also an alternative controller as Deployment, why we use both?
Endpoint API is used for k8s native applications, for FO4 it use Virtual IP and kube-proxy. In this case, does Endpoint API is still used?

2. Do we need to ask about helm roll back operation?
