# How to replace a failed secondary node in mongod replica set

1. Start a new mongod server with mongod config file and init file copy from existing hidden secondary mongod server
(including create new db folder)
2. Start the mongod service by init script (service XXXX start)
3. Check mongo log (syslog in our case) to make sure the mongod is running without error
4. Go to current primary mongod, login to mongo, check current repilca status
mongo --port <port> -u <user> -p (then manually input password in prompt)
(rs.status, rs.conf)
5. Add the new member (http://wiki.jingle.cn/display/GREP/FO3+DB+Shrink#FO3DBShrink-Setupreplicaset)
(Add with priority:0, vote:0, for not to disturb current primary)
rs.add( { host: "IP:port", priority: 0, votes: 0 } )
var cfg = rs.conf();
cfg.members[3].priority = 1
cfg.members[3].votes = 1
rs.reconfig(cfg)
(Check the mongo log of the new member, to see it join without error)
6. Drop the previous failed member (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/remove-replica-set-member/)
(The ID is based on array position, not _id)
rs.remove("IP:port")
7. Check replication lag (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/remove-replica-set-member/)
rs.printSlaveReplicationInfo()
